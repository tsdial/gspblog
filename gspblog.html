<div>The Netflix original series Bojack Horseman tends to break the expectations of everyone watching it. What starts out as a silly adult comedy about Hollywood elite, chock full of absurd word play, quickly reveals its heart. An informal review it receives quite often is “too real.” To those who haven’t yet watched the series, it may seem like an ironic statement, given the anthropomorphic animal characters and over-the-top situations. </div>
