    <b>Introduction</b> <br>
    The Netflix original series <i>Bojack Horseman</i>, a seemingly ridiculous animated comedy about a washed-up sitcom actor who also happens to be an anthropomorphic, wisecracking horse, tends to break the expectations of everyone watching it. What starts out as a silly adult comedy about Hollywood elite, chock full of absurd word play, quickly reveals its heart. An informal review it receives quite often is “too real.” To those who haven’t yet watched the series, it may seem like an ironic statement, given the anthropomorphic animal characters and over-the-top situations, but few animated shows make me feel quite as many emotions as this one. </div>

<h5 id="abortion">All I Wanna Do Is <q>Brrap Brrap Pew Pew</q></h5>
<p><cite>Bojack Horseman’s</cite> take on the often-controversial topic of abortion, an episode onomatopoetically entitled <q>Brrap Brrap Pew Pew,</q> is just as insightful and progressive as its other material. The gist of the episode is that one character, Diane Nguyen, learns that she is pregnant and decides to get an abortion. Due to comedic antics, she accidentally tweets <q>I’m getting an abortion</q> from a celebrity client’s account. This celebrity, a dolphin cheekily named Sextina Aquafina, realizes that being the face of the pro-choice movement is helping her image and could potentially be extremely lucrative. She capitalizes on this by releasing a song entitled <q>Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus.</q> Diane voices her disdain for this song, both because Sextina is co-opting a movement in which she does not have a legitimate stake and because she believes its violent and irreverent lyrics give the pro-life movement ammunition. Diane also butts heads personally and professionally with her boss Princess Carolyn over their differing reproductive situations as well as a <q>live TV abortion</q> scheme Sextina and PC concoct. During her visit to the clinic however, Diane speaks to a young woman who is a fan of Sextina’s song. She says that it’s funny and makes her feel like she’s not alone. The episode concludes with Princess Carolyn and Diane making up, and Diane reaffirming her decision to have an abortion.</p>
<p>Before delving too deeply into the episode itself, I’d like to analyze the song <a href="https://genius.com/10144653" target="_blank"><q>Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus.</q></a> The name itself is so bold and provocative, it’s difficult to say with a straight face, which is part of its genius. Nothing about this episode is precious, and this song exemplifies that quality perfectly. The opening lyrics <q>I’m a baby killer/ baby-killing makes me horny/ Alien’s inside me/ gonna squash it like Sigourney</q> are shocking enough to make Sidewalk Advocates for Life drop their hand-crocheted guilt-booties. These lyrics also don’t shy away from the pop-star’s sexuality, even if it is for shock value. Reminding the audience of the fact that consensual, enjoyable sex can occur surrounding abortions pushes back against the <q>respectable</q> pro-choice narrative that uses sexual violence and other extreme situations as common ground to compromise pro-choice ideals in favor of a wider audience. Obviously, these extreme situations should not be ignored, but the idea that abortions are only okay when a pregnancy results from rape or incest erases many abortion seekers’ realities and further stigmatizes them. The clever nod comparing herself to the Sigourney Weaver’s famously badass <cite>Alien</cite> character rounds out the opening verse. Later in the song, Sextina boldly declares that she <q>have [sic] abortions always,</q> working further to destigmatize abortions. The song’s final verse makes impeccable use of dramatic irony and knowledge of the procedural aspects of abortions:</p>
<pre>
        Sometimes I do have doubts and it’s hard to sleep.
        I think about my child’s heartbeat and, oh, it makes me weep.
      	I hope and pray to God my little fetus has a soul
      	Because I want it to feel pain when I eject it from my hole.
</pre>
<p>These first two lines, along with the tonal shift in the music, create a sense of remorse, almost veering into a pro-life direction. Hidden in these lyrics however is a metaphorical middle-finger to the policies in place forcing abortion-seekers to listen to their fetus’s heartbeat before they can proceed. The irony is revealed in the final line, with a lyric Diane finds so outlandish that she believes it is doing more harm than good to the pro-choice movement. The young woman in the clinic teases Diane for taking the lyric seriously, telling her that Sextina obviously doesn’t actually want to shoot her fetus with a gun. <q>When you can joke about [abortion],</q> she says, <q>it makes it less scary.</q> Ultimately that is the point of this song: to find comfort in something so hilariously and outlandishly abortion-positive.</p>
<p>When Diane finds out she is pregnant at the beginning of the episode, there was an expectation set in my mind based on previous media I had consumed surrounding the possibility of abortion, most notably <cite>Juno</cite>. I expected her to consider an abortion, but although she had absolutely no intention of being a mother, she would ultimately decide that it was time and have the baby. <cite>Bojack Horseman</cite> smashed my expectations, to my delight. The conversation between Diane and her husband, Mr. Peanutbutter (an anthropomorphic golden retriever), in the car afterwards is exactly what I had always wanted in a discussion about abortion. They inform the audience through their conversation that they had previously discussed not wanting children. Mr. Peanutbutter reassures Diane that it is entirely her decision because she is the pregnant party. Diane wants Mr. Peanutbutter to know that although it is ultimately her decision, they are deciding together and his input is valuable. They are ultimately in agreement that Diane should get an abortion. This decision is never second-guessed, unlike in many other portrayals. Too often in representations of abortion in art, abortion is seen as a scary, life-altering decision which one may ultimately regret if they make the wrong choice. Even well-meaning productions still tend to stigmatize abortion by making it seem fraught with danger or drama. What is so wonderful about this episode is how clearly free Diane is to make her choice, without ignoring legal realities such as waiting periods and guilt tactics.</p>
<p>Diane accidentally tweets <q>I’m getting an abortion</q> from Sextina’s Twitter account, which she manages. The audience sees a brief news clip in which the anchor asks <q>Is Twitter an appropriate forum to be discussing a sensitive issue like abortion?</q> This questions highlights a popular way of shutting down important conversations that aren’t happening in news rooms. This same response is given any time a black person protests injustice. His follow-up question, <q>Wouldn’t a better forum be nowhere?</q> cements this dismissal as out of unwillingness to discuss it, rather than any desire to have a conversation in an ‘appropriate’ setting. This shows both the way that the way young people communicate and have dialogues are often dismissed by ‘legitimate’ sources like news outlets, and portrays the unwillingness to have frank discussions about difficult topics, especially ones involving the autonomy of often oppressed people. In the next scene, Sextina is about to fire her when Diane checks the account and sees that Taylor Swift tweeted to Sextina that she’s <q>brave.</q> This kind of performative feminism is exactly what Swift is known for--an issue not directly brought up in the episode, but one that is important to note. Sextina changes her mind about firing Diane, saying <q>if I can make one woman feel a little less alone, then it’s all worth it, right? And if I can make a million women buy my album, then it’s definitely all worth it.</q> Diane, the moral guide for those watching at home, feels uneasy about this, understandably. Money is Sextina’s and Princess Carolyn’s main motivation, which doesn’t spawn genuine activism, and Sextina is not really pregnant, making Diane feel as though Sextina is co-opting a movement in which she has no genuine interest. Diane concedes however, because it is her job, but insists that Sextina </q>get informed</q> by accompanying her to her abortion consultation appointment.</p>
<p>Diane’s initial trip to abortion clinic with Mr. Peanutbutter and Sextina in tow (just like in real life, they have to have two) plays out in a way that, while comedic, is all too familiar for those seeking abortion care. The doctor orders Diane to watch cute puppy videos alone, despite Mr. Peanutbutter’s offer to watch the videos for her or at least with her. The doctor also tells Diane that legally he has to inform her that <q>at one month [her] puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue</q> which Diane notes <q>can’t be true,</q> but the doctor can only offer in response that he has to tell her that, legally.  This is all played for comedy, but it is also a biting satire of the real life legal<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/requirements-ultrasound" target="_blank"> requirements </a>in order to get an abortion, which force doctors to perform ultrasounds and give sometimes false information to patients to guilt them.</p>
<p>Later on, Sextina (with Diane just offstage) makes an appearance on a television program called <q>Excess Hollywoo [sic]</q> because this is, first and foremost, a satire of Hollywood celebrity culture. A <q>Ryan Seacrest Type</q> asks Sextina about her abortion in ridiculous terms marking the discomfort many men feel when faced with topics like this. Sextina then tells him and the public that she is <q>very excited to put a face on this important issue</q> and recites the oft-cited <q>one in three</q> statistic. While this number is slightly <a href="http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/jan/19/wendy-davis/flawed-wendy-davis-claim-1-3-women-has-had-abortio/" target="_blank">misleading</a>, it does come from actual data, but <q>A Ryan,</q> rather than engaging on that point and probing where that number comes from, simply replies <q>that number sounds crazy high to me! I don’t buy it,</q> which is what far too many men say. Sextina’s reply is for America to get its <q>uteruses turnt [sic]</q> for her new single, discussed above. Diane watches in shock and horror as the music video for <q>Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus</q> plays on national television. <q>I think the tone might be a little severe?</q> Diane implores her teenaged client, to which Sextina replies <q>when you get an abortion, you can express yourself however you want, but this is about my body and my choices, and my choice is to be a totally insane badass!</q> This reply mimics the second wave rallying cry, while also poking fun at the idea of choices. On one level, we can see that Sextina has an enormous amount of privilege to be able to express herself in such an unconventional way and she has easy access to an abortion, if she did actually need one. Many abortion seekers face few choices, whether because of practical and monetary barriers set in place by the government or even the choice to carry the pregnancy to term and care for a child. Additionally, her response is another prime example of the kind of performative, ‘girl power’ feminism that pervades Hollywood.</p>
<p><q>Has the concept of women having choices gone too far?</q> asks the news anchor from earlier in the episode in the segment just after Sextina’s song airs on <q>Excess Hollywoo.</q> The anchor then turns to his <q>diverse panel of white men in bow ties</q> to discuss this question and abortion. These caricatures espouse exaggerated versions of common anti-abortion rhetoric such as ‘I’m unbiased because I’m a man,’ ‘the body can shut down pregnancy if necessary,’ and citing the Bible. This segment, while hilarious, is also infuriating because of how close it is to the truth.</p>
<img src="itsaborted.png" style="float:right; width:420px; margin-right: 20px;">
<p>Later, in Sextina’s hot pink Hummer stretch limosine, Diane explains her worry that the song and Sextina’s general attitude is <q>giving the pro-life movement something to latch on to</q> showing that abortion is violent and that women are not capable of making rational decisions about it. Sextina, whose concerns are money and attention, is not interested in this conversation, asking if she can <q>abort talking to</q> Diane. The shot then pans out to one of my favorite jokes of the entire episode, a very supportive Mr. Peanutbutter holding the balloon pictured to the right. This casual abortion joke is so fantastic because there is no butt of it, it’s just an incredibly clever visual joke. After a moment to soak in the last joke, Diane pushes her point further, saying that they have the opportunity to say something important and therefore must while they have the public’s attention. This point speaks to Sextina, but exactly how is not yet clear.</p>
<p>In her next scene, Sextina reveals to the news anchor that she is going to <q>have her abortion live on television!</q> This scene immediately cuts into a scene of her in Princess Carolyn’s office with Diane, discussing what they are going to do about this. Diane asks how Sextina can have an abortion live when she is not actually having an abortion at all, to which Sextina replies <q>Argo that shit,</q> implying that they will fake the whole thing with <q>movie magic</q> as Princess Carolyn offers. Diane is incredulous, calling it <q>disrespectful.</q> Princess Carolyn accuses Diane of making this about her, when she should be focusing on her client. Princess Carolyn takes it a step too far when she brings in Diane’s personal life and her decision to have an abortion. Unlike Diane, Princess Carolyn desperately wants children but is unable to because of her age and womb. In a later episode, she reveals that she has had five miscarriages. It was still inappropriate to call into question Diane’s personal choices based on her own issues, but framing this conversation with context does explain her response and paint her as a more realistic character, who despite having pro-choice beliefs, does still want a family and cannot fully detach from that.</p>
<p>The penultimate scene in the abortion storyline shows Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter entering a <q>Planned Parrothood</q> for her abortion. Mr. Peanutbutter is doing his best to be <q>247%</q> supportive of Diane as she rants about Princess Carolyn and Sextina. She is determined to put a stop to their plan, resolving to go on the news and <q>rat those suckers out,</q> until a young woman overhears her talking about Sextina. She tells Diane that Sextina’s music makes her <q>feel strong, like [she] can do anything.</q> This in itself is important, even if Sextina is in it for the money. She did make one woman feel a little less alone, which was at least part of her goal.</p>
<p>In the final scene, Diane and Princess Carolyn are watching the <q>live abortion</q> together while Diane recovers from her procedure. Diane calls it <q>surprisingly tasteful</q> and <q>weirdly educational,</q> saying that she learned a lot despite having just undergone the procedure herself. When Princess Carolyn asks Diane how she is feeling, her response is <q>shitty,</q> coming dangerously close to falling into the same trap as most other television and film portrayals. However, she follows that response immediately with <q>physically. I mean, I’m glad I did it.</q> She also says that she feels old, being in her thirties contrasted with teens and <q>twenty-somethings.</q> She feels like she should be <q>ready for kids</q> because of her age, but that’s not her path. Princess Carolyn reassures her that she doesn’t <q>need to explain [her]self to anyone</q> in a touching final moment before the show returns to the absurd. </p>
<p>In conclusion, this show has one of the most pro-choice and non-stigmatizing portrayals of abortion on television. It is of course not without its issues: not all people seeking abortion are women, Diane is far more privileged in terms of money and location than most seeking abortions. But this is still a huge step in the right direction. Hopefully one day, abortion will be de-stigmatized in the media, and the regrettable abortion storyline will be the anomaly, not the rule. That day is unlikely to come any time soon, but shows like this are pushing the boundaries and helping to make abortion less scary.</p>
<br>
<h5 id="women">Bojack and Women</h5>
<p>In the show, the titular character suffered a horribly unpleasant childhood and currently suffers from alcoholism and likely depression. This information is to frame—but not excuse—a major plot device used throughout the show, which is one of Bojack’s vices and the situations it creates, one with which I analyze in my head frequently, trying to reconcile it. Bojack’s three main vices are alcohol, food, and women. The third is the one that bothers me.</p>
<p>The show is progressive in a lot of ways, which makes the fact that Bojack has slept with or at least tried to sleep with every female character on the show, save the lesbians and his relatives, all the more frustrating and regressive. That he’s somewhat of a failed Casanova makes the fact easier to swallow. The writers clearly aren’t framing this in a positive or sexy light. Still, given this fact, it’s hard not to believe the female characters are there as props.</p>
<p>He habitually sleeps with his agent, Princess Carolyn, who frequently puts out fires for him, figuratively and literally. She is constantly attempting to remove herself from his personal life, to no avail. She eventually begins dating <q>Vincent Adultman,</q> a character who only Bojack acknowledges is actually three children in a trenchcoat, in order to make him jealous. He admits to <q>Vincent</q> at the end of the episode that he <q>doesn’t like the idea that [he] can’t</q> date Princess Carolyn now that she’s in a relationship, despite not actually wanting her. This toxic mentality is something that he fully acknowledges but cannot let go of. Later in the series, once their professional relationship has been severed, she describes what she believes is his ideal woman as <q>a mommy [he] can slip [his] dick in and out of.</q> Bojack then agrees to wanting what he calls a <q>sex mommy</q> which is just entirely too much to unpack right now without delving into a Freudian hellscape about which I’m not interested in writing. Essentially though, his needs are emotional as well as physical, but not in a sense generally considered healthy in relationships. He seeks emotional maturity from a partner, but has none to offer in return. </p>
<p>Next on the roster of unhealthy relationships is Diane Nguyen, the ghostwriter of Bojack’s autobiography. Due to the professional aspect of their relationship, Bojack opens up to her far more than he normally does with women, beginning to create this unhealthy dynamic. He begins to develop feelings for her which she does not reciprocate. He pursues her for most of the first season despite the fact that she has expressed no sexual interest and has been in a romantic relationship for the entire time that they’ve known each other. After he tries to kiss her, they have an incredibly stilted conversation about how they are just friends and she is getting married before she gets out of the car while stopped at a light, miles from her house. <q>Why’d you have to have to make things weird, Bojack?</q> Diane laments after telling him that she won’t be interviewing him anymore for the book. Bojack doesn’t listen to her at all and continues to pursue her throughout the episode despite the fact that she is getting married. The show borrows the tired trope of a third party psyching up the man to ‘chase his girl’ with a pep-talk from Character Actress Margo Martindale, but smashes expectations when Bojack shows up to stop the wedding. He proclaims to his friend Todd that he is <q>finally going to tell her how [he] feel[s]</q> to which Todd responds <q>she knows how you feel… she made her choice.</q> Without Todd laying this out for the audience, the episode and the dynamic would have a very different feel. Instead of playing into the unrequited love and ‘getting the girl’ tropes, the show tells us that these are weird and inappropriate. Diane has agency, unlike many romantic female leads. Even though the plot is mostly wrapped up in this episode, after the whole predicament is over, it still causes tension between Bojack and Diane, and her husband Mr. Peanutbutter and Bojack. At the end of the second season, Diane comes back from a long trip early, and instead of going home to her husband Mr. Peanutbutter, she stays with Bojack and his then girlfriend Wanda, creating more tension between all four of them and ultimately creates unfixable rifts in their relationships with each other.</p>
<p>More unsettling is the sexual relationship that occurs between Bojack and Sarah Lynn, a young woman who starred as his youngest daughter on <cite>Horsin’ Around</cite>, the 90s sitcom that gained him fame. Due to her early exposure to fame and money, Sarah Lynn is extremely maladjusted. In an early episode, she reunites with Bojack after being dumped by Andrew Garfield and stabbing herself with a bayonet. He lets her stay with him and their relationship goes from the weird dynamic of ‘terrible father and adult child’ to the disgusting one of ‘terrible father figure having sex with adult child.’ Although he feels that she is taking advantage of him by trashing his home, Diane points out that he is more taking advantage of her. She came to him for help, and he tries to be a father to her to relieve his guilt from being unkind to her while filming two decades prior. While they are both adults, and both have <q>substance abuse problems and daddy issues,</q> she is in a much more precarious position, and again, was seeking some type of help.</p>
<p>At the end of season two, Bojack leaves Los Angeles following Diane’s question about when the last time he was happy. He makes his way all the way to New Mexico to surprise Charlotte, a woman he knew briefly in the 90s. Because she is a normal fifty-year-old, she is not available and has a husband and kids. Her daughter Penny is seventeen years old and looks much like her mother (they are both deer). Bojack takes Penny to prom, which starts out innocent enough, sort of like a dad going with his daughter. Weird, but not creepy. He actually rebuffs her affections as a somewhat responsible adult. But, because he is horribly dysfunctional, things shift to creepy. He first tries to talk Charlotte into running away with him. He tries to kiss her and she rejects him. Then he goes back to his boat, which he bought to cover up the fact that he drove from LA to New Mexico to see Charlotte. Penny is waiting for him and they go back into his boat. Nothing happens because Charlotte comes and threatens to call the police, but his horrible deed lives with him throughout the series. This is impossible to fully reconcile, which is what makes it such a powerful plot device. I hate it, but it forever cements him as an anti-hero. The show specifically makes her just legal in order to make the situation gray. Is he a pedophile? No, but it is still incredibly inappropriate and sick. He knows this too. I think what’s important about this show is that while Penny initiates, they don’t try to paint her as some sort of ‘jailbait’ seductress. She’s an emotional teenager who wants to feel special. He’s a man her father’s age who absolutely should’ve known better, and this is acknowledged.</p>
<p>The least unhealthy sexual and romantic relationship he has is with Wanda Pierce, an owl who has no idea who he is because she spent 30 years in a coma, missing the entirety of his rise to fame. Her lack of knowledge about him is what initially draws him to her. The main issue in their relationship is similar to others: he has an intense desire to be loved and wanted, but is unwilling or unable to reciprocate in a healthy, mature way. He spends an entire episode planning to <q>autoerotic asphyxiate</q> himself in a convoluted attempt to get her to admit that she loves him, but when she finally does admit it, he does not reciprocate. This lack of reciprocation should be read as an inability to be vulnerable rather than a genuine lack of romantic attraction and affection. When they do break up, it is largely because of his overwhelming bitterness and negativity. <q>When you’re wearing rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags,</q> Wanda laments before leaving forever.</p>
<p>Bit characters are written in ultimately to be sexual objects in order to characterize Bojack as sexually dysfunctional. In the beginning of the second episode, a girl is laughing at him and taking pictures of him. He confronts her with a monologue about how because she is pretty, she feels entitled to do whatever she wants, and that she is a <q>horrible person</q> for that. All she hears is <q>pretty</q> and the scene cuts to them in bed together, and he says <q>well, that was another in along series of regrettable life choices.</q> He often attempts to fill the void in his soul with sex among other vices, and is never satisfied. Later in the series, he attempts to sleep with a journalist, but when she reminds him of another almost-sexual encounter he had with Penny, he freaks out and tells her everything in his drunken and depressed hazed.</q>
<q>Someone might wonder why these seemingly intelligent and emotionally mature women would invest their time in someone so self-centered and bitter. One might even question if they were simply written poorly. This is understandable, but Bojack himself offers an explanation in the episode where he and Wanda break up: <q>You didn’t know me so you fell in love with me. Then you got to know me.</q> This is supported by the fact that most of his non-business relationships tend to last only as long as he can sustain positivity. But he’s not all bad. He’s funny and charismatic and occasionally very sweet. That’s why Princess Carolyn sticks around, although she does find adult relationships in more emotionally mature men. Diane and Bojack eventually recover from most of the awkwardness, there is little indication that they have any romantic feelings for each other. He may have some sort of sexual or romantic entanglement with most of the women in his life, but what the show is really trying to show, it seems, is that he is unable to maintain any healthy sexual or romantic relationship because of his horrible childhood combined with his fame while he was still relatively young.</p>
<p>This unhealthy characteristic is also part of a larger characterization of him as <q>poison</q> or <q>broken.</q> He feels that he is unable to have healthy relationships of any kind, and this manifests itself most noticeably in his sexual and romantic ones. Overall, these women are full characters outside of their sexual relationships with Bojack. While they may all have this relationship with him, most of them have other sides to that relationship, and have relationships with other characters. As the show unfolds, these characters become more complex and less identified by their relationships with Bojack. They have friendships, careers, families, and personal lives that do not revolve around him, although he occasionally forgets that. Is his relationship with the women in his life generally healthy? Absolutely not. But that reflects more on his own characterization and terrible childhood than the women around him.</p>
